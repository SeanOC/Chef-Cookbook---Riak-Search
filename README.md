DESCRIPTION
===========

Installs and configures Riak Search along with the required version of Erlang.

Right now this cookbook is fairly immature so use at your own risk.  As part of that 
immaturity it is currently only designed to work with ubuntu/debian type distros.  It 
shouldn't be too much work to get it working on red hat flavor distros so any pull
requests adding support would be welcome.
